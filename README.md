# DOS-HRIS
A retro-styled HRIS demo

DOS‑HRIS 🖥️
A retro‑styled Human Resources Information System (HRIS) built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Inspired by classic DOS terminals, this project delivers a text‑mode interface for managing employees, leave requests, and payroll — all in a nostalgic CRT‑style design.

✨ Features
Retro DOS UI: Monochrome theme, ASCII borders, scanlines, and keyboard‑centric navigation.

Login system: Simple authentication with mock user data.

Main menu: Navigate via arrow keys, Enter, Esc, or Alt+hotkeys.

Employee directory: Search, filter, and view employee records.

Leave requests: Submit and track vacation, sick, or personal leave.

Payroll stubs: View and print pay stubs for selected periods.

Settings: Switch themes (green, amber, gray), toggle CRT scanlines, and sound effects.

About screen: Retro credits and keyboard shortcut guide.
